# CharCounterInput

Hello everyone,

Here's another project from among my front-end learning journey. I hope you like it. This project is quite simple and small. It works like this: it has a straightforward input field for entering a username, and the maximum allowed character count for the username is 20. With each character entered into the input field, one of the numbers next to the input field decreases. When the limit is reached, it prevents further typing, and the number goes down to zero.

This small and simple project was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

If you enjoyed it, I would greatly appreciate it if you could give it a star. Thank you! You can access the project page through this link and explore it further.
